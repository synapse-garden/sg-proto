SG-Proto Orgfile

* v0.5.0+ ?
** MF task kernel integration
** Cascading store.Delete / store.Update?
** Map TODOs to Github Issues?
** Map TODOs to SG streams / items?
** Multi-part Stream receives

* v0.4.0 ?
** Versioned REST API?
** Apple / etc Push API?
** Distributed storage?
*** If so, MUST revise Surv / Resp rivers!!!
** Cassandra / etc bigtable backend?
** Offer River connections besides Websocket?
** Consider package-global caching optimizations to things such as
      user ID hashes

* v0.3.0 ?
** Refactor Streams database funcs
*** Marshal, Unmarshal, Delete, Get etc. take multi bolt Buckets
** Secure ticket "incept" endpoint (can you just hammer it with UUIDs?)
** Concurrent store.Wrap?
** Concurrent store.Wrap with dep chains?
** Dep chains?
** DB interface + cache?
** Optimize buckets / transactions in packages?  Pass needed behaviors
   through store package?  NewTickets, etc. inefficient
** Store.WrapBucket(store.Bucket(...), ...Transact)
** Decide about capnproto / protobuf for Bolt / Rivers
** Read-only Streams
** Finer-grained read authorization, public / private / circles?
** Only one notification stream exists per user
** Package user can specify how it works
** Consider using a salted hash for stream topics
** Consider globally buffering all streams

* v0.2.0 ?
** Notif global Topic
** Decide whether auth.Refresh should delete and exchange the given refresh token
** "Friendly UUIDs" -- map 4-bit chunks to phonemes or small words?
** "HTTP Errors" -- this is really two problems.
*** JSON-serialized form errors that can be used to indicate problems
    in a context-friendly way
*** HTTP error codes which have some relevance to the API user to help
    clarify what went wrong without passing forward sensitive data.
** Better database testing -- maybe a memory mapped file or some other
   option so our setups / teardowns don't have to thrash the filesystem.
** Testable rest.Bind
** Maybe a database mock?
** Caching database wrapper
** Use bolt batch
** Bucket threading
** Transaction type to replace func tx blah
** Better ErrorMissing / ErrorExists context messages
*** HTTP / Display Error interface which has Code and Message suitable for users
*** ValidationError interface which tells the client what keys / etc are wrong?
** Figure out whether we can find a logical mapping for UUID / base64
   shasum strings
** Notification topic performance
*** Individual publishers for GUIDs instead of API-global
**** Group.Hash -> GUID unique by users (?)
***** Create and destroy Group pub rivers on Group update
***** API pub river publishes to GUID subscribers, GUIDs publish to
      their subscribers (???)
***** Clarify this API / sketch up some tests
** Refactor websocket Connect REST methods into nested testable steps
** Actual OAuth2 registration for app clients

* v0.1.0
** Bugs
*** Users can't understand missing session Error() string since it's bytes
**** Configure error output to match expected values: base64 shasums or
     UUID strings
*** Invalidate / reissue auth token after refresh
**** Figure out how to thread session context through this

** Dev mode
*** Specify me
*** No database?
*** Use given mock file as initial store?
*** Expose endpoints without sessions?
*** Default superuser logins given?

** Errors
*** An interface is provided for API-serializable errors
*** An interface is provided for non-lethal errors
**** IsLethal
**** Stop returning bools from websocket Conn reader

** Unorganized
*** Organize TODOs

*** Cloud (self?) deploy service

*** Better testing of REST resource security.
*** More auth.Login tests
*** Ledger?
*** Make sure all empty GETs return [], not null
*** Future: Scribe is a single Sub Recver which is created on init
    and cannot be hung up, senders double-post to it
*** Update README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md, clean up 0.0.1 TODO
*** Log ERROR statements on all unexpected internal errors
*** Make sure not just anyone can get a refresh token
*** Comment all exported functions, types, methods, and constants
*** Tighten up Convo REST API, add deferred cleanups
*** GET /admin/tickets?per_page=n&page=m
*** Performance is weak (~30ms on GET on /source)
**** Is it just Postman?
**** Benchmarking?
**** Bolt?
***** Configure cache settings?
*** POST to /tokens should return any valid existing token of user.
**** Debatable.  Tokens come with timeouts which are unchanged.
**** If user is using a refresh token, it will refresh;
**** For now, this isn't really a "bug".  It just means tokens bucket
     can get overfull.
*** Diagnose occasional test failures in RiverSuite.TestNewBus
*** If a survey has a problem, responders are in an unknown state.
*** Old Bus buckets should be deleted after the convo or stream is deleted.
*** Bad usernames cannot be looked up for expired Sessions
**** This is just a reverse lookup.
**** Can't find example of why this is a bug.
*** If database is closed, can't clean up rivers
*** No auth timeout / river / notifs closure
*** User set type
*** Think about true vs false users in groups -- use slice in API?
*** Think about compressing Notes.
*** Figure out some technique to formalize state translation
    permitted on group membership instead of manually checkin
    everything.  Permitter interface{ Permit(u) bool } minimum?
    Implement on methods?
**** Make a few simpler experiments.
*** Map out bounty interactions fully and consider irreversible bounty.
*** -wipe flag to reset DB
*** Consider an "antifragile" failure-friendly design approach
*** Figure out a way to sort things in local database instead of
    random order due to UUID keys.  Incremental ID in bucket for local
    ordering, with UUID "ID" value for stored object when there's a
    universal object?
*** Profile Bounty needs transaction ledger of some kind -- think about it
*** Use store.ID **everywhere** -- store.Marshal / store.Unmarshal
    at least
*** Do some revisions to store.LoadStorer / etc -- maybe there's a
    better way.  A struct containing an ID with Store / etc methods?
*** Think about conditioning.
*** Many users doing synchronous Task updates could lock things up --
    find a better way.  Maybe all Tasks should be LRU cached with a
    lazy Mutex that only serializes in case of collision?  Could this
    be done with channels instead?
*** Solve the problem of name collisions in Task and Stream / Convo
*** Unify Stream and Convo -- maybe they could just be identical and
    you pass the bucket to the API
*** Marshalable ID type (uuid.UUID with {Unm|M}arshalJSON)
*** Refactor to DSL for endpoint definition -- we want this to be easy
    to extend
*** Caching / indexing helpers
*** High-level intelligence design
*** "Resource" interface to make CRUD much, much simpler
*** DONE The design of Rivers must support a future implementation which
    CLOSED: [2017-03-16 Thu 09:21]
    permits the API to use req/rep Rivers to control the behavior of
    receivers.
 - [x] Reorganize streams package with more abstraction
 - [x] Standardize on JSON camelCase vs snake_case etc
*** All the database backend stuff is a spaghettified nightmare since
    each package manages its own database behaviors.
*** Tighten down and offer Streams as a CLI option.
*** Remove self from stream / convo if you don't want to be in it,
    even if you don't own it.
*** Redesign streams / hangup event chains
*** Don't encode the same resource over and over for notifs.
*** No way of cleaning up failed Scribes
*** REST resources as interface / code gen?
*** Tighten up convo message funcs
*** Make convo message blocks
*** Test convo message db funcs
*** Messages keyed by ID instead of date
**** Migration for this?
*** Test notif hangups
*** Make a helper function to make hangups easier to use.
*** ws.HangupSender a horrible mess.  Do something better, for the
    love of God!
*** REST Stream tests brittle
*** Survey response errors need a useful error implementation.
*** Swagger HTTP API doc
